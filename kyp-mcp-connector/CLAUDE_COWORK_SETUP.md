# Connecting KYP MCP Connector to Claude Cowork

## Important: Your MCP server must be publicly accessible

Claude Cowork runs in the cloud and connects to your MCP server over the internet. **localhost URLs will not work.** You need either:

1. **Deploy the connector** (Railway, Render, Fly.io, etc.) — recommended for production
2. **Use a tunnel for local testing** (e.g. ngrok) — for quick testing before deployment

---

## Option A: Local testing with ngrok

1. **Start your MCP server:**
   ```bash
   cd kyp-mcp-connector
   npm start
   ```

2. **In another terminal, start ngrok:**
   ```bash
   ngrok http 3100
   ```

3. **Copy the HTTPS URL** ngrok gives you (e.g. `https://abc123.ngrok-free.app`)

4. **Your MCP endpoint URL is:** `https://abc123.ngrok-free.app/mcp`

---

## Option B: Deploy to production

Deploy the connector to Railway, Render, or similar. Set environment variables (`KYP_MCP_API_KEY`, `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`) in the platform's dashboard.

Your MCP endpoint will be something like: `https://your-app.railway.app/mcp`

## Use the connector in chat

1. Start a new conversation or open an existing one
2. Click the **+** button (or "Add" / "Connectors" in the chat interface)
3. Enable the **KYP** connector for this conversation
4. Ask Claude to use KYP — e.g. "List my projects" or "Show me user journeys for project X"

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "Connection failed" | Ensure your server is running and the URL is reachable (try opening it in a browser — you may get 405 for GET, which is expected) |
| "Unauthorized" | Verify `KYP_MCP_API_KEY` in your `.env` matches what you entered in Claude |
| Tools don't appear | Check that the server is running and the URL ends with `/mcp` |
| Empty data | Verify `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` are set correctly |

---

## Verify the connection

1. **Health check:** Open `https://your-url/health` in a browser — you should see `{"status":"ok",...}`
2. **MCP endpoint:** The `/mcp` endpoint expects POST requests with JSON-RPC. A GET request may return 405 — that's normal.
3. **In Claude:** Ask "What KYP tools do you have?" or "List my KYP projects" to test.
