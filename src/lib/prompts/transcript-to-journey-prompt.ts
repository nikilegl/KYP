  return `You are analyzing a meeting transcript that may contain ONE OR MORE separate user journeys. Extract the following information and return it as valid JSON:

YOUR ONLY JOB: Extract content and connections. Do NOT calculate positions.

IMPORTANT: Return ONLY valid JSON, no markdown formatting, no code blocks, no extra text.

CRITICAL RULES - CONTENT EXTRACTION ONLY:
- Extract: node labels, types, roles, platforms, connections (edges), bullet points
- Do NOT calculate or output any position fields (x, y, width, height)
- Do NOT try to replicate layout or spacing - that is handled by a separate system
- Focus on accuracy of content and connections

DETECTING MULTIPLE JOURNEYS (CRITICAL):
- A transcript may describe MULTIPLE SEPARATE user journeys that should NOT be connected to each other
- Common patterns indicating separate journeys:
  * "Current process" vs "Future process" / "New process with Legl"
  * "What we do now" vs "What it will be using Legl"
  * Different process types: "Pay process", "KYC process" (onboarding individuals), "KYB process" (onboarding businesses)
  * "Before" vs "After" comparisons
  * Different workflows for different scenarios
- When you detect separate journeys:
  * Create nodes for ALL journeys in the same nodes array
  * Only create edges WITHIN each journey - NEVER between different journeys
  * Each journey should have its own start node and end node
  * Use clear, distinct labels to differentiate journeys (e.g., "Current: User logs in" vs "Future: User logs in")
  * Add a prefix to node labels if helpful (e.g., "Current Process:", "With Legl:", "KYC:", "KYB:", "Payment:")

Extract:

1. Nodes: Each step or action mentioned in the transcript
   - id: Generate a unique identifier (e.g., "node-1", "node-2")
   - type: Determine if it's "start" (first step), "process" (middle step), "end" (final step), or "label" (contextual information with no connections)
   - data: An object containing the following properties:
     * label: The main text/title describing this step
     * type: Same as the top-level type ("start", "process", "end", or "label")
     * userRole: The EXACT role name performing this step. Available roles in this workspace: ${rolesList}. 
       IMPORTANT: Match the exact casing and wording from the available roles. ONLY use roles from the list above. If the role mentioned in the transcript doesn't exactly match an available role, choose the closest match. If completely unsure, use the first role from the list.
     * variant: If platform mentioned, one of: "CMS", "Legl", "End client", "Back end", "Third party", or empty string ""
     * thirdPartyName: If variant is "Third party", include the name of the third party service (e.g., "Stripe", "Auth0", "Mailchimp", "Salesforce"). Otherwise, leave as empty string "".
     * bulletPoints: Array of any detailed actions or sub-steps mentioned
     * notifications: Array of notifications (pain points, warnings, info, positive feedback) related to this step. Each notification should have:
       - id: unique identifier (e.g., "notif-1")
       - type: one of "pain-point", "warning", "info", "positive"
       - message: the notification text
     * customProperties: Empty object {}

2. Edges: Connections/flow between steps
   - id: Generate unique identifier (e.g., "edge-1-2")
   - source: The id of the source node
   - target: The id of the target node
   - label: Only include a label if the edge is part of a branch/conditional path (e.g., "If purchase", "If successful", "On error"). For strictly linear, non-branching flows, set "label" to an empty string "".
   - data: An object containing:
     * label: Same text as the top-level label. For strictly linear, non-branching flows, set to an empty string "".

3. Metadata:
   - name: Title of the journey (infer from transcript context)
   - description: Brief summary of the overall flow

NOTE: In the second example, there are TWO separate journeys (Current and Future). 
- Nodes 1-2 form the "Current" journey (connected by edge-1-2)
- Nodes 3-4 form the "Future" journey (connected by edge-3-4)
- NO edge connects node-2 to node-3 because they are separate journeys

Guidelines:
- CRITICAL: All node properties (label, type, userRole, variant, thirdPartyName, bulletPoints, notifications, customProperties) MUST be inside the "data" object
- DO NOT include position fields - layout is calculated separately
- Analyze the transcript to identify distinct steps in the user journey OR multiple separate journeys
- Identify clear start and end points from the conversation flow
- Carefully detect connections between steps to create accurate edges
- MULTIPLE JOURNEYS: If the transcript discusses multiple separate processes (e.g., current vs future, KYC vs KYB vs Pay), create separate unconnected node groups:
  * Example: If discussing "current onboarding" and "future onboarding with Legl", create two separate flows with no edges between them
  * Example: If discussing "KYC for individuals" and "KYB for businesses", create two separate flows
  * Use label prefixes to clearly differentiate (e.g., "Current:", "Future:", "KYC:", "KYB:", "Payment:")
- Each separate journey should have its own "start" node and "end" node
- Nodes within the same journey should be connected with edges; nodes from different journeys should NEVER connect to each other

USER ROLE DETECTION (CRITICAL):
- Pay close attention to who is performing each action in the transcript
- ONLY use roles from this list: ${rolesList}
- Match the EXACT casing and spelling from the available roles
- If multiple roles are mentioned for a single step, choose the primary actor
- If no role is explicitly mentioned, infer from context and choose the closest match from available roles
- When in doubt, use the first role from the available roles list

PLATFORM/VARIANT DETECTION:
- Look for platform indicators like "CMS", "Backend", "Legl", "the system" and put in data.variant
- IMPORTANT: If you hear third-party service names (Stripe, Auth0, Mailchimp, Salesforce, HubSpot, Slack, Twilio, DocuSign, etc.), set data.variant to "Third party" AND set data.thirdPartyName to the service name

EDGE LABELS:
- Main path edges (continuing straight down): empty labels ""
- Conditional/branch edges (diverging to alternate paths): descriptive labels like "If purchase", "If successful", "On error"
- Convergence edges (from branches back to main flow): empty labels ""

BULLET POINTS:
- Extract any mentioned sub-steps, details, or specific actions as bulletPoints in the data object
- Keep bullet points concise and actionable
- Only extract explicitly mentioned sub-steps, not general descriptions

NOTIFICATIONS:
- Detect pain points, warnings, information, and positive feedback mentioned in the transcript
- Types: "pain-point" (problems, issues), "warning" (cautions, risks), "info" (notes, context), "positive" (successes, improvements)
- Each notification needs: id (unique), type (from above), message (the actual text)

FINAL REMINDERS:
1. Focus on accurate content extraction and connection detection
2. DO NOT include any position information
3. CRITICAL: If transcript contains multiple separate journeys (current vs future, KYC vs KYB vs Pay, etc.), create separate unconnected node groups
4. Listen for key phrases: "current process", "what it will be using Legl", "KYC", "KYB", "payment process", "onboarding individuals", "onboarding businesses"
5. Each separate journey needs its own start and end nodes with NO edges connecting different journeys
6. Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text`
